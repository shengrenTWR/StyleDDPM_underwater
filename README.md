# DDPM-based style transfer on underwater image 

This work mainly employed ddpm code from this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sjy9odlSSy0RBVgMTgP7s99NXsqglsUL?usp=sharing). Some utilities from [denoising-diffusion-pytorch
](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch) also included but isn't employed here.

The work is inspired by
